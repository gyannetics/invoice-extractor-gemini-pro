# Using Gemini Pro LLM for invoice extraction
Note: You can get the API access from [Google API](https://makersuite.google.com/u/2/app/apikey).  
Also you are expected to update the `app.py` with your API Key for it to work!

### 1. Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Run the App using Streamlit
```
streamlit run app.py
```

### 3. Add `invoice` documents accepted in `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png` formats
